# std.http.proxy reverse-proxy core integration tests.
#
# Verifies (mode=simple):
#   1. Basic round-trip: GET / through proxy → 200 + upstream body
#   2. Hop-by-Hop headers stripped both directions
#   3. X-Forwarded-For appended correctly (preserves prior values)
#   4. X-Forwarded-Proto + X-Forwarded-Host injected
#   5. Via: 1.1 aether-proxy injected
#   6. Host: rewritten to upstream's host (preserve_host=0 default)
#   7. POST body round-trips byte-identical (1 KiB)
#   8. Refuses Upgrade-bearing requests with 502 +
#      X-Aether-Proxy-Error: upgrade_unsupported
#   9. Custom request header reaches upstream
#  12. A response header value too long for the small-value buffer
#      survives the proxy whole
#  11. A request split across several writes, with the header
#      terminator itself cut in half and the body arriving last,
#      still completes
#  13. Two requests pipelined into one segment both get answered
#  14. A forwarded chain too long for the append buffer survives whole
#
# Verifies (mode=timeout):
#  10. Upstream sleep 3s vs proxy timeout 1s → 504 within ~1.5s
