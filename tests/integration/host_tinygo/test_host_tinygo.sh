# Issue #261: contrib/host/tinygo end-to-end smoke test.
#
# Skips cleanly when the Go toolchain is not on PATH (matches
# contrib/host/go's pattern — host bridges should never break CI on
# machines that don't have the toolchain installed). When `go` IS
# available, the test builds a c-shared .so, loads it via
# contrib.host.tinygo, and exercises every wrapper signature.
#
# NOTE on the build command: this used `tinygo build -buildmode=c-shared`
# historically, but TinyGo 0.34.0 restricts that buildmode to wasm
# targets ("buildmode c-shared is only supported on wasm at the moment").
# The bridge is a runtime dlopen — it doesn't care which compiler
# produced the .so, only that it's a valid c-shared with the exported
# symbols. We use standard `go build -buildmode=c-shared`, which works
# natively on linux/darwin and produces a binary-compatible .so. The
# "tinygo" name on the bridge is retained as the brand; the toolchain
# choice is a build-time detail.
