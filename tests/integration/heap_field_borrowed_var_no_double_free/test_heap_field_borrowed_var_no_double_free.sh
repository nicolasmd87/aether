# A heap-string struct field assigned from a heap-tracked local that holds a
# BORROWED value at runtime must move the source's runtime ownership into the
# field tracker, not hard-code it to 1. Hard-coding 1 made the destructor free
# a value the program never owned (a literal -> free of rodata), aborting at
# teardown. This is the closure/FFI-callback shape a downstream HTML sanitizer
# hit: a hook returns a literal, threaded through `-> string` helpers into a
# heap-boxed attr field, double-freed on free.
#
# Running to completion is half the assertion (a double free / rodata free
# aborts with SIGSEGV or SIGABRT). The emitted ownership move is checked
# directly too, so this means something on CI platforms with no leak checker.
