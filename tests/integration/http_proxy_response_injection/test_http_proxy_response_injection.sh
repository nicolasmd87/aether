# The reverse proxy must not forward a header whose value carries a bare CR or
# LF. Such a value does not end a line on the wire, so it reaches the code that
# writes the client's head intact; written out verbatim it would end that head
# early and let the bytes behind it be read as headers the upstream never sent
# (CWE-113, response splitting).
#
# The upstream here is hostile and speaks raw bytes, which is the only way to
# send a header value an HTTP server would never produce.
