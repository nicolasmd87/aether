# The proxy must not let an upstream inject headers into the client's response.
#
# A bare CR or LF inside a header value does not end a line on the wire, so it
# survives parsing as part of that value and reaches the code that writes the
# client's head. Writing it out verbatim would end the head early and let the
# rest be read as headers the upstream never sent (CWE-113, response
# splitting). This stands a hostile upstream in front of the proxy and reads
# the raw bytes the client actually gets.
#
# Two roles, because the proxy has to be told the port its upstream landed on
# and the kernel only names that port once the upstream has bound it:
#
#   upstream <portfile>  bind port 0, write the port, answer as the upstream
#   client <proxy_port>  drive the requests and check the bytes that come back
#
# One hostile header per response, on purpose. A bare CR ends the header scan
# on both paths, so a response carrying both would never reach the check that
# rejects a value holding a bare LF, and removing that check would not fail
# this test.
