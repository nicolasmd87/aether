# HEAD framing and middleware keep-alive (#1653).
#
# Three things this pins, each of which was wrong:
#   - a HEAD response carries no body. It used to carry the GET body, which
#     RFC 9110 forbids and which desynchronises a persistent connection: the
#     client reads those bytes as the head of the next response.
#   - HEAD on a path with only a GET route answers 200, not 404. There were
#     two route lookups and only one had the fallback; the keep-alive path,
#     the one that actually serves, did not.
#   - a response produced by a middleware that answers keeps the connection
#     open. That path sent its response and closed, whatever the server's
#     keep-alive setting said, which is why the load balancer (whose proxy
#     answers exactly this way) closed every inbound connection.
