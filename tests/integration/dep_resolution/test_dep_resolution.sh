# #1901: [dependencies] resolve onto the module search path, with overrides.
#
# `ae add` installed packages that nothing read back, so every consumer wrote
# its own shell script to guess the cache layout and spell each importable
# subdirectory into --lib. The datastar-aether line reported this after their
# hand-written resolver guessed wrong (two path levels, not three), silently
# fell through to a sibling checkout that happened to exist, and stayed green
# for weeks while the package path had never once worked.
#
# Asserts:
#   - a declared dependency's module roots join `ae lib-path`
#   - `ae run` resolves an import from it with NO --lib at all
#   - the CONSUMER never spells the package's internal paths: the publishing
#     package declares them in its own [package] modules
#   - a missing dependency names itself and the fix, not "unknown module"
#   - a package that declares nothing exports nothing, and says so
#   - --override and [patch] both redirect, and both ANNOUNCE it -- the
#     property the ask cared most about, since a silent override means a green
#     local run against a working copy CI does not have
