# The server holds far more keep-alive connections than it has workers (#1663).
#
# A worker owned its connection for that connection's whole life, so the
# number a server could hold open was the worker count (cores * 2, capped at
# 64). Past that line, connections that never reached a worker stalled their
# clients: 200 concurrent keep-alive clients measured 99 rps against 71,000
# after parking, and this test's own first run served 300 connections once and
# then only 16 of them a second time, which is the shape of the bug.
#
# So the property is: open many more connections than any plausible worker
# count, serve every one, and then serve every one AGAIN on the same socket.
# The second round is the test. The first only proves the server is up.
