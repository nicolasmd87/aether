# A proxied response answered from the upstream's own bytes must be the same
# bytes the copying path would have produced.
#
# The fast path rebuilds the response head itself rather than serialising a
# response object, so it can disagree with the copying path in ways no
# single-path test would show: it did, on HEAD, where the copying path states
# the length of the body it is sending (none) and passing the upstream's
# header through would have claimed a body that never arrives.
#
# So the comparison is the test: the same requests through the same proxy with
# the fast path on and off, diffed byte for byte, headers and body.
