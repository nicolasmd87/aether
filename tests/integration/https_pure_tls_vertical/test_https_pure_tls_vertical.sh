# HTTPS end to end with a pure-Aether TLS client: our std.http server on one
# side, std.cryptography.tls13_client on the other, one HTTP/1.1 exchange
# framed over the raw TLS stream.
#
# Why this exists. std.http.client's HTTPS path is OpenSSL
# (std/net/aether_http.c), so `ae build --target=` -- which links no OpenSSL --
# returns "HTTPS requested but the build has no OpenSSL support" at runtime.
# A downstream port read the tree, concluded HTTPS was impossible in a cross
# build, and filed asks/http-client-pure-tls-backend-for-crossbuild.md asking
# for a pure TLS backend to be written.
#
# Most of it already exists: tls13_client is a complete pure-Aether TLS 1.3
# client with full server authentication, and it cross-builds. What was
# missing was anything demonstrating that, which is what this test is. It
# pins the vertical slice so the claim is checkable rather than asserted, and
# gives the std.http.client integration a target to match.
#
# The client half deliberately uses NO OpenSSL. The server half still does
# (std/net/aether_http_server.c terminates TLS with SSL_accept), so this
# proves one direction; a pure server needs tls13_hs to gain a ClientHello
# parser and a ServerHello builder, which it does not have yet.

# A self-signed cert for 127.0.0.1. The client authenticates the server for
# real -- chain, validity and hostname -- so the cert has to carry an IP SAN
# and be handed to the client as its trust anchor.
# MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL: on MSYS2 the shell rewrites any argument that looks
# like a POSIX path, so `-subj "/CN=127.0.0.1"` reaches openssl as
# "C:/Program Files/Git/CN=127.0.0.1" and it refuses the subject.
#
# Scoped to the subject prefix rather than '*'. Excluding everything also
# stops the -keyout/-out paths being converted, and openssl then cannot open
# "/tmp/tmp.XXXX/key.pem" on Windows at all -- which swaps one failure for
# another. Verified both ways on a real MINGW64 box: '*' reproduces
# `Can't open ... for writing`, '/CN=' produces the right subject and both
# SANs. Inert on Linux, where the output is identical with and without it.
