# #623 regression: editing a module behind a SYMLINK on the
# `AETHER_LIB_DIR` search path must invalidate the build cache.
#
# Pre-fix bug: compute_cache_key only mtime'd the lib dir itself.
# A dir's mtime only bumps on create/delete/rename of an entry, NOT
# on an in-place edit of a file behind a symlink that points outside
# the dir. So editing the symlink target left the dir mtime
# unchanged, the cache key stayed stable, `ae run` served the
# previously-compiled binary, and edits looked like no-ops until
# `rm -rf ~/.aether/cache`.
#
# Fix: compute_cache_key now walks each lib_dir's top-level entries
# and folds each entry's resolved-target (`stat`, follows symlinks)
# mtime + size into the key. ae also now seeds tc.lib_dirs[] from
# AETHER_LIB_DIR up front so the walk runs even when only the env
# var (no --lib flag) is set.
