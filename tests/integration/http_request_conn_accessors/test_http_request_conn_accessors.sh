# The addresses are resolved once per CONNECTION and cached (#1719), not
# fetched per request. That is only correct if every request on a reused
# connection still reports them — a cache populated for request 1 and not
# read back for request 2 would leave the later ones empty, which no
# single-request check would notice.
#
# curl's multi-URL form reuses one connection, so this drives three
# requests down one socket and requires all three to agree. The peer PORT
# is the sharpest field here: it is kernel-assigned per connection, so if
# the cache were somehow refreshed mid-connection it would still match,
# but if it were dropped the field would go empty.
