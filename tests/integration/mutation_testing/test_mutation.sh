# Regression test for the std.mutation mutation-testing driver
# (adopted from aeocha contrib/mutate; run via the runnable front-end
# at examples/mutation-testing/mutate.ae).
#
# Runs the driver against a deterministic fixture (fixture/sut.ae +
# sut_test.ae) where exactly two operator sites exist:
#   - `add` is tested      -> ADD->SUB mutant KILLED
#   - `mul` is NOT tested   -> MUL->DIV mutant SURVIVES
# so the run must report exactly "1/2 ... 50%" with a MUL->DIV survivor.
#
# Asserts four things:
#   1. baseline (unmutated suite) passes,
#   2. the exact mutation score line,
#   3. the expected survivor is listed,
#   4. the SUT is restored byte-identical (md5 before == after) — the
#      safety-critical property; a driver that corrupts source is worse
#      than no driver.
#
# POSIX-only (the driver shells out via rm/ae and the oracle assumes
# /bin/sh); skipped on Windows and where `ae` is not built.
