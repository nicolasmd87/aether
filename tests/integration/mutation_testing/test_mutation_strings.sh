# Regression for std.mutation's STRING-literal mutation + the
# operator-in-string skip (string-boundary awareness).
#
# fixture_str/sut.ae has three string literals and one of them (help)
# contains an arithmetic operator INSIDE the string ("a + b"):
#   - name()  is tested        -> STR->EMPTY killed
#   - motto() is NOT tested     -> STR->EMPTY survives
#   - help()  is NOT tested     -> STR->EMPTY survives
# and there are NO code-level arithmetic operators, so the run must be
# exactly "1/3 ... 33%" with two STR->EMPTY survivors.
#
# Asserts:
#   1. baseline passes,
#   2. exact score "1/3 ... 33%",
#   3. a STR->EMPTY survivor is reported (string mutation works),
#   4. NO ADD->SUB mutant appears — the ` + ` inside help()'s string was
#      skipped (the boundary-awareness / false-mutant fix),
#   5. SUT restored byte-identical.
