# Regression: fs.write_atomic must not follow a symlink planted at the
# predictable tmp path. CVE-class: previously `fopen(tmp, "wb")` would
# follow `<path>.tmp.<pid>.<counter>` if an attacker pre-created it as
# a symlink to /etc/passwd or similar, and the subsequent fwrite would
# overwrite the symlink target. Fix: open with O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW.
#
# Repro shape: plant a symlink at the next-likely tmp path, run
# fs.write_atomic, confirm (a) the call FAILS rather than silently
# overwriting the symlink target, (b) the target file's content is
# unchanged.
