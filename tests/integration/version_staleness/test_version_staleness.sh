#!/bin/sh
# `ae version` and a failed build say when a newer release exists.
#
# The reason this exists: `ae upgrade` always worked, and nothing ever said to
# run it. Every check in `ae version` compared the binary against its own
# siblings and never against what had been released, so an install 75 releases
# behind reported itself healthy while `ae run` answered from its stale stdlib
# and reported functions added since as undefined.
#
# Hermetic: HOME points at a temp dir and the cache is seeded, so no case here
# reaches the network. That is also the property under test in the last case,
# since `ae version` must answer without it.
#
# Asserts:
#   - behind the latest release: `ae version` names it and points at upgrade
#   - level with it: silent
#   - the comparison is numeric, not lexicographic (0.1000.0 is NEWER than
#     0.627.0, and a string compare says the opposite)
#   - a failed build carries the same hint, on stderr, and prints its
#     diagnostics exactly once
#   - `ae run` does the same, since it has its own copy of that path
#   - level with it, a failed build stays silent
#   - a seeded cache is honoured, so no fetch happens
