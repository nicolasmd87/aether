# #260 Tier 0 / Phase C3: parallel keep-alive sessions through the
# drain helper. Drives 4 parallel curl clients, each issuing 25
# requests over its own TCP connection, and verifies all 100
# responses arrive cleanly with no cross-session pollution.

# Skip on Windows — the HTTP server / proxy / middleware code path
# under test is platform-independent userland C; the Linux and
# macOS CI matrix entries already exercise every behaviour this
# test asserts. Each curl invocation under MSYS2 bash pays Cygwin
# fork-emulation + Defender + slower-than-POSIX localhost overhead
# (~10-100x POSIX's per-spawn cost), so running these on Windows
# adds minutes to the pipeline without adding coverage. Windows-
# specific runtime concerns (file I/O, process spawning, path
# handling) are covered by fs_*, std_ipc_*, run_lib_path, and
# ae_help tests respectively.
