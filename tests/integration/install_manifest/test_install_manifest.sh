# Issue #329 regression: `make install` (and install.sh) ship an
# authoritative MANIFEST listing link-suitable runtime + stdlib .c
# files for downstream consumers (aetherBuild and similar tools
# that compile against the share/aether/ source tree).
#
# Verifies:
#   1. install.sh writes share/aether/MANIFEST.
#   2. Every non-comment, non-empty line in MANIFEST resolves to a
#      file that actually exists under share/aether/. Catches drift
#      where Makefile RUNTIME_SRC / STD_SRC reference a path that
#      didn't get copied (or was trimmed by the rm -rf step).
#   3. The MANIFEST contains a sensible number of entries (>10).
#      Catches a silently-empty MANIFEST that would still "exist"
#      but be useless to consumers.
#   4. None of the trimmed paths (runtime/examples/, runtime/io/)
#      sneak into the MANIFEST. Catches drift the other direction
#      where a MANIFEST entry references content the trim removed.
