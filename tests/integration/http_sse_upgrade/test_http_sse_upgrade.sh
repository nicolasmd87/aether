# Upgrade-in-place SSE: response_upgrade_sse + the `retry:` field.
#
# `server_sse` registers a whole ROUTE as SSE, so the decision is made before
# the request is parsed. A handler that must answer 400 on a malformed body and
# only THEN stream cannot use it -- which is why the Datastar SDK bypassed the
# stdlib entirely and seized the raw socket with response_accept_tunnel. That
# works, but accept_tunnel returns NULL on a TLS connection, so every SSE
# endpoint built that way is plaintext-only.
#
# Asserts:
#   - a handler can answer 400 WITHOUT upgrading (the reason for the seam)
#   - an upgraded stream carries the fixed SSE head
#   - `retry:` is emitted, in spec order (id, event, retry, data). 5 of the 20
#     Datastar cross-SDK conformance goldens require it, and it is SSE's own
#     reconnection field, not a Datastar invention
#   - upgrading over an already-committed body is REFUSED, so that body is not
#     silently lost
#
# Skips on Windows for the same reason http_server_sse does: this is
# platform-independent userland C and each curl under MSYS2 costs 10-100x a
# POSIX spawn.
