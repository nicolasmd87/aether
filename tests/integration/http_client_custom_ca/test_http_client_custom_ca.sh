# Regression: #1107 (set_cafile) + #1110 (the pinned CA must be the TRUST
# anchor, not merely loaded). Starts an Aether TLS server whose leaf cert is
# signed by a private root CA (SAN IP:127.0.0.1) — the Proxmox-VE topology —
# then runs an Aether client that hits it three ways: pin the correct ROOT CA
# (must verify -> 200), pin a WRONG CA (must fail closed), and no cafile (system
# store must reject the private chain). This is the "verify, but against THIS
# cert" path — strictly stronger than set_insecure. See client.ae.
#
# Skips cleanly when openssl is missing or the build has no OpenSSL.
