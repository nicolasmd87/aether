# Starts an in-process Aether TLS server with a self-signed cert, then runs an
# Aether client that hits it twice: default (must reject the cert) and
# client.set_insecure(req, 1) (must succeed). See client.ae for the assertion.
#
# Skips cleanly when openssl is missing or the build has no OpenSSL.

# Skip on Windows — TLS client/server code is platform-independent userland C
# already covered by the POSIX matrix; MSYS2 openssl + fork overhead adds
# minutes without coverage.
