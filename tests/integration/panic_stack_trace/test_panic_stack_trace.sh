# Issue #347 regression: aether_panic prints a filtered stack trace
# to stderr before aborting when there's no try/catch frame. The
# trace is best-effort under -O2 (tail-call + inlining can collapse
# user frames), but the "Stack trace" header and at least one frame
# (typically `main`) must always appear; otherwise the runtime
# regressed back to the silent `panic outside any try/catch` line.
#
# Tests the codegen-side `panic("...")` path. Contract violations
# and signal-converted panics use the same fallback printer once
# they reach aether_panic, so this also exercises the runtime
# branch.
