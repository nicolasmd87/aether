# A TLS-terminating reverse proxy, served by the event driver.
#
# TLS connections used to be refused by the driver and given a thread each --
# the cost the driver exists to remove, on the shape most proxied traffic
# actually arrives in. The driver now carries the handshake without waiting and
# reads and writes through the session.
#
# The concurrency here is the point as much as the round trip: the failure this
# path had was not a wrong answer but a server that stopped existing, and one
# request at a time never showed it.
