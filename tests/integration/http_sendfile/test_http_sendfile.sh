# Issue #383 — zero-copy sendfile(2) fast path for http_serve_file.
#
# Verifies:
#   1. Cleartext HTTP/1.1 GET of a 1 MiB binary file produces a
#      byte-identical body. Sendfile path is the one used.
#   2. Two requests over a single keep-alive connection both succeed
#      (Content-Length matches sendfile bytes; otherwise the second
#      request would read garbage from the leftover body).
#   3. Range request → fallback to buffered path; response is still
#      200 with full body (Range slicing is v2; falling back is the
#      documented behaviour).
#   4. 404 path doesn't leak FD (server still serves further
#      requests; verified by a follow-up GET).

# Skip on Windows — the HTTP server / proxy / middleware code path
# under test is platform-independent userland C; the Linux and
# macOS CI matrix entries already exercise every behaviour this
# test asserts. Each curl invocation under MSYS2 bash pays Cygwin
# fork-emulation + Defender + slower-than-POSIX localhost overhead
# (~10-100x POSIX's per-spawn cost), so running these on Windows
# adds minutes to the pipeline without adding coverage. Windows-
# specific runtime concerns (file I/O, process spawning, path
# handling) are covered by fs_*, std_ipc_*, run_lib_path, and
# ae_help tests respectively.

# --- Test 5: a SMALL file must arrive without waiting for the close ---
# T2 uses the 1 MiB blob, which is larger than the socket buffer, so the
# kernel has to push it whatever the sendfile path does with TCP_CORK /
# TCP_NOPUSH. A small file fits, and then nothing forces the push: on Darwin
# and the BSDs, clearing TCP_NOPUSH does not send what is queued, so the
# response reached the client only when the connection closed. That is
# invisible while a worker goes straight back to recv() on the socket, and a
# hung request once idle connections are parked instead (#1663).
#
# Two requests on one connection is what pins it: curl cannot send the second
# until the first response arrives, so a response held back stalls here rather
# than being papered over by the close at the end of the test.
