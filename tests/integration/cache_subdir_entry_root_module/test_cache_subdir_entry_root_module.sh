# Regression (#1882): editing a PROJECT-ROOT module must invalidate the cache
# when the entry file sits in a SUBDIRECTORY.
#
# Module resolution is CWD-relative (aether_module.c "Try 3-6": src/<m>/module.ae,
# <m>/module.ae, <m>.ae, all probed from the process's cwd), so a project-root
# module resolves for an entry file anywhere. But the cache key hashed only the
# directory the ENTRY sits in (#1421) — the project root when you run
# `ae run main.ae`, and NOT when you run `ae run tests/suite.ae`, where it
# hashed tests/ and never saw the module that actually got compiled.
#
# `tests/<suite>.ae` importing a module from the project root is the ordinary
# layout for an Aether project's own test suite, so this sat on the default
# path: editing the module under test left the key unchanged and the suite
# re-ran the PREVIOUS binary. The failure mode is the bad one — a test suite
# reporting GREEN against code it never compiled.
#
# Asserts both directions, since a cache that never hits would also "pass" a
# staleness check while making every run slow.

# Asserted by COUNTING CACHE ENTRIES, not by timing. Two earlier attempts used
# a clock and both were wrong: an absolute "< 80ms" encoded the speed of the
# box it was written on (a slow macOS runner needed 159ms for a genuine hit),
# and a rebuild-vs-hit ratio was flaky because the "forced rebuild" could
# itself hit a warm entry built earlier in this test. A hit reuses an entry and
# a miss creates one, so the entry count answers the question exactly, on every
# machine, with no timing at all.
# Ask `ae` how many builds it has cached rather than counting files under a
# path we guessed. The guess was "$HOME/.aether/cache", which is wrong on
# Windows: ae resolves the cache under USERPROFILE (C:\Users\...), while a
# shell under MSYS2 reports $HOME as /home/... -- two different directories, so
# the count was 0 on both sides and the assertion compared 0 to 0. `ae cache`
# prints "Cache: N build(s), ..." from the same code that writes them.
