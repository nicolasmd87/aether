# std.http.client must not replay credentials across a host change (#1739).
#
# http_strip_cross_host_headers drops Authorization, Cookie and
# Proxy-Authorization when a redirect hop changes authority. That is the
# behaviour that stops a bearer token reaching a host the user never
# authorised, and it had no runtime coverage: the existing redirect test
# asserts the API surface (set_follow_redirects returns "", rejects -1) and
# never follows a hop.
#
# One server, two hops on the same port under different host names, and the
# same-name control is what gives the cross-host assertion meaning: a client
# that dropped the headers unconditionally would satisfy the first assertion
# and fail the second.
#
# The port is held equal across both hops so this test isolates the host.
# A port change strips too, since #1741 made the decision compare the whole
# origin; tests/integration/http_redirect_cross_port covers that half.
