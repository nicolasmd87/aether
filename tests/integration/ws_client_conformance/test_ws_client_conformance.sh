# WebSocket CLIENT conformance against an INDEPENDENT RFC 6455 implementation.
#
# This is the mirror of tests/integration/http_server_websocket (their client,
# our server). Here the peer is a python3-websockets SERVER and the client
# under test is ours.
#
# Why both directions matter: tests/integration/ws_client_loopback dials our
# own server, so an error both ends make together is invisible to it -- if we
# masked outbound frames the wrong way AND unmasked them the same wrong way,
# the echo still round-trips. A third-party peer has no such symmetry: the
# websockets library enforces RFC 6455 s5.1 and closes on an unmasked or
# mis-masked client frame, so this test fails where the loopback one passes.
