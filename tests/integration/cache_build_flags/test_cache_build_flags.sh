# Regression: aether.toml's [build] cflags must invalidate the build cache.
#
# The cache key covered the source tree, the -D symbols and --trace, but not
# the manifest's toolchain flags, which go straight onto the gcc line. Editing
# `cflags` therefore printed "Built (cache hit)" and served the binary built
# with the OLD flags. It was found staging an ASan workspace over an
# already-built tree: the build reported success and handed back the
# uninstrumented binary, so the sanitizer run measured nothing.
#
# Asserts both directions: a flag change must rebuild, and an unchanged build
# must still hit (a cache that never hits would pass a staleness check while
# making every build slow).
