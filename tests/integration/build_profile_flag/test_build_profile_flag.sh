# `ae build --profile` emits a binary a sampling profiler can attribute.
#
# The three build modes are meant to be distinct:
#
#   default    -O2, no debug info      what ships
#   --quick    -O0 -g                  fast iteration; the WRONG tool for a
#                                      profile — at -O0 nothing inlines and
#                                      every temporary stays live, so the hot
#                                      spots are not the shipped binary's
#   --profile  -O2 -g -fno-omit-...    the shipped code, attributable
#
# Before --profile existed, profiling std.http.server.lb meant emitting the C
# with aetherc and hand-compiling it: the default build carries no DWARF and
# omits frame pointers, so gdb resolved 239 of 240 sampled frames as `??`.
#
# Asserts:
#   - default carries no .debug_info
#   - --quick and --profile both do
#   - --profile is genuinely -O2, not -O0 wearing a -g: its binary is
#     substantially smaller than --quick's
#   - --profile keeps frame pointers (fewer rbp pushes than -O0, but the
#     debug info is what the check above covers; this pins the -O2 half)
#
# Skips cleanly when readelf is absent (non-ELF hosts).
