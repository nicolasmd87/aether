# The Vulkan headers are header-only and platform-independent, so the host's
# copy is what the cross compile reads. Two things make "just use the host's
# include flags" wrong here:
#
#   - `pkg-config --cflags vulkan` is EMPTY when the headers sit in the default
#     system include directory, which is right for a native compile and useless
#     for a cross one: the MinGW compiler does not search /usr/include.
#   - pointing the cross compiler at /usr/include instead puts glibc on its
#     include path, and it fails in bits/libc-header-start.h.
#
# So the header trees are copied into a scratch directory that holds nothing
# else. vk_video/ is needed as well as vulkan/: vulkan_core.h includes
# vk_video/vulkan_video_codec_h264std.h.
