# `ae version doctor` — diagnose an install, and prove it by compiling.
#
# The reason this exists: `ae --version` never invokes the compiler. It
# reports a healthy toolchain on an install that cannot build anything, so
# every check that only compares version strings inherits that blindness.
# The doctor's last check is an actual compile, and this test's centre of
# gravity is that the compile probe FAILS on a broken toolchain -- a doctor
# that always says "ok" is worse than none.
#
# Asserts:
#   - a healthy tree reports no problems and exits 0
#   - a missing libaether.h is reported (the gap a release actually shipped)
#   - a toolchain that cannot compile is reported, even though every
#     string-comparison check above it still passes
#   - a pin naming an UNINSTALLED version is repaired by --fix
#   - a pin naming an INSTALLED version is left alone by --fix, because
#     that is a choice between two real installs rather than a fault

# need an `ae` that is not in dev mode. Copy the binary somewhere with no
# runtime/ beside it AND run from a directory that is not a source tree --
# detection falls back to the CWD, so running from $ROOT is dev mode however
# the binary was invoked.
