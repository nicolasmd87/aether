# Every installed public header must compile on its own.
#
# `std/**/*.h` and `include/*.h` ship in the install tree, so a consumer can
# include any one of them directly. A header that only compiles because some
# other header happened to be included first is broken for that consumer, and
# nothing checked it: the MSVC job compiles a handful of runtime headers under
# cl.exe as a portability probe, and stops there.
#
# This came out of removing `std/aether_std.h`, an unused umbrella header that
# covered 7 of 44 std headers and could not be completed, because two of them
# (#1433) define conflicting `HttpRequest` types. Self-containment is the part
# that IS true today, so it gets pinned here before it stops being true.
#
# When #1433 is fixed, the pair check belongs in this file too: compiling the
# HTTP client and server headers in one translation unit is the case that
# regression would break.
