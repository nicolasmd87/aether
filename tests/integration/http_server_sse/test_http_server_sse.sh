# #260 Tier 2 / Phase E3: Server-Sent Events end-to-end.
#
# Connects to /events with curl -N (disable buffering) and verifies:
#   - Content-Type: text/event-stream header
#   - 3 events received with the expected event names + data
#   - third event carries id: evt-3
#
# Skips when curl is missing.

# Skip on Windows — the HTTP server / proxy / middleware code path
# under test is platform-independent userland C; the Linux and
# macOS CI matrix entries already exercise every behaviour this
# test asserts. Each curl invocation under MSYS2 bash pays Cygwin
# fork-emulation + Defender + slower-than-POSIX localhost overhead
# (~10-100x POSIX's per-spawn cost), so running these on Windows
# adds minutes to the pipeline without adding coverage. Windows-
# specific runtime concerns (file I/O, process spawning, path
# handling) are covered by fs_*, std_ipc_*, run_lib_path, and
# ae_help tests respectively.
