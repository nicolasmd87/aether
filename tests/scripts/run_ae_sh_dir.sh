# Lives in a real file rather than being generated into $tmpdir by the recipe
# for the reason documented at length in run_ae_test.sh beside it: the

# Windows command-line cap that `mingw32-make` passes recipes through, and the
# truncated tail broke the sweep on every Windows source build.
#
# Behaviour is unchanged from the generated version on every platform.
