"""Compile the documentation's complete code blocks (#1522).

`docs/`, the README, and each module's co-located README carry hundreds of
```aether blocks. Some are whole
programs a reader can copy and run; most are excerpts. Only the first kind can
be compiled, and until every block said which it was, neither kind was checked:
`http.server_listen`, a `cryptography.base64_*` that never existed, a reserved
word as a parameter name and a tutorial teaching a non-boolean `if` all shipped
in documentation and were found by hand.

The convention is the fence's info string:

    ```aether             a complete program. Must compile. CHECKED HERE.
    ```aether,run         a complete program that is also RUN, and whose stdout
                          must match the ```output block immediately after it.
                          Use for anything whose value is what it prints.
    ```aether,fragment    an excerpt: no main, or it references names the page
                          established earlier, or it contains a literal `...`.
                          An exercise stub whose body is `// Your code here`
                          is one of these: it is a program the READER
                          completes, so it does not compile as written.
    ```aether,fails       a deliberate counter-example. Must NOT compile, and
                          this fails if it starts compiling.
    ```aether,nolink      a complete unit that cannot link BY ITSELF: it calls
                          C the reader supplies, or it is a library whose
                          `main` lives in the host app. Built like any other
                          block; the ONLY failure allowed is unresolved symbols
                          at the link, since that is precisely what lives
                          outside the block. Prefer this to `fragment` for
                          anything that really does compile: a fragment is
                          skipped, this is checked through codegen and the C
                          compiler.

A `run` block is followed by its expected output:

    ```aether,run
    main() { println("hi") }
    ```
    ```output
    hi
    ```

Compiling proves a function exists; running proves it does what the prose
claims. The base64 example that shipped wrong in two files would have been
caught by either, but an example whose OUTPUT drifted needs the second.

`fragment` is not an escape hatch for a broken example. It says the block is
not a program; if a block has a `main()` and is meant to work, leave it bare so
this compiles it.

Needs a built ./build/ae (skips cleanly without one).
