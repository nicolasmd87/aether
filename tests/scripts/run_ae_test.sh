# Build and run one .ae test, recording the outcome as marker files in $tmpdir
# for the sweep in the Makefile's `test-ae` target to tally afterwards.
#
#   run_ae_test.sh <test.ae> <tmpdir> <repo-root>
#
# Invoked once per test file, in parallel, by `xargs -P` from `test-ae`.
#
# Why this is a real file rather than being generated into $tmpdir by the
# recipe (which is what it used to be, ~35 `printf` lines):
#
#   `mingw32-make` passes a recipe to `sh -c` over a Windows command line that
#   is capped at 8 KB. The generated-script version pushed the single joined
#   recipe line to 11,679 bytes, so `sh` received exactly 8,191 of them — cut
#   mid-`printf`, leaving an unterminated quote:
#
#       /usr/bin/sh: -c: line 78: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
#       mingw32-make: *** [makefile:1235: test-ae] Error 2
#
#   That made `make test-ae` (and so `make test-all` / `make ci`) fail outright
#   on a Windows source build. CI never caught it because the Windows job runs
#   the MSYS2 `make`, a Cygwin-style binary that execs `sh` directly and has no
#   such cap — but README tells users to install `mingw-w64-x86_64-make`, which
#   *is* `mingw32-make`.
#
#   `sweep_resource_probe.sh` next door exists for the same family of reason:
#   non-trivial shell does not survive Makefile escaping intact.
#
# Behaviour is unchanged from the generated version on every platform.
