/* std.config — process-global immutable string→string KV store.
 *
 * Models BEAM's persistent_term: set during program initialisation,
 * read from anywhere for the rest of the process's lifetime. The
 * canonical use case is CLI flags / config-file values that get
 * parsed once in main() and need to be reachable from request
 * handlers entered later (notably from C-callback handlers where
 * Aether-typed parameters can't flow through).
 *
 * Storage: a single process-global hashmap protected by a pthread
 * rwlock. Reads (the hot path) take the read lock; put / clear take
 * the write lock. The pattern Nico cited in the design call:
 * "set during init, read everywhere".
 *
 * Values are duplicated on put so the caller's string lifetime
 * doesn't matter. Returned values from get are *borrowed* — they
 * remain valid until the next put or clear that touches the same
 * key. For "set once at startup, never mutate" usage this is fine;
 * if you need to update keys mid-flight, copy the result via
 * string_concat(get(key), "") before the next put.
 *
 * Thread-safe. NUL-terminated values only — for binary content,
 * encode (base64, hex) or use a different mechanism. */

/* Insert / overwrite. Both `key` and `value` are duplicated
 * internally. NULL key or NULL value is a no-op. */

 * (matches Aether's Go-style "" = absent convention) — never
 * returns NULL. The pointer is borrowed from the registry's
 * internal storage; it stays valid until the next put / clear
 * touching the same key. */
