A compiled actor language whose permissions are part of the source, enforced from compile time down to libc (the libc layer on Linux/FreeBSD; Windows gets the compile-time and scope layers). No VM and no garbage collector: the compiler emits readable C.

**Website: [aether-lang.dev](https://aether-lang.dev/)**

## Overview

Most languages treat "what may this program touch?" as a deployment problem. Aether makes it a language problem: code runs against an explicit grant list, enforced three times over. At compile time, `--emit=lib` starts capability-empty and the host opts modules in with `--with=fs,net,os`. At scope level, `hide` and `seal except` stop ambient names from leaking into any lexical block, a closure, a trailing-block DSL, an actor handler. At runtime, an `LD_PRELOAD` shim checks libc itself (`open*`, `connect`/`bind`, `execve`, `mmap`, `dlopen`, `getenv`) against the same grants, inherited across `execve` — this third layer is Linux/FreeBSD only (there is no `LD_PRELOAD` on Windows). See [Containment Sandbox](docs/containment-sandbox.md) for the threat model, the prior art it draws on, and the known bypass surface.

Concurrency is actor-shaped: `actor`, `receive` and `!`, with automatic multi-core scheduling, lock-free mailboxes, and migration that converges chatty actors onto one core. The compiler emits readable C, not bytecode and not a VM, which is an implementation choice rather than the pitch: it buys native speed, direct linking against existing C libraries, and a runtime that ports anywhere a C toolchain reaches.

**Where it sits on the OO / FP spectrum:** structs are plain data, behaviour lives in free functions, and closures and trailing blocks are first-class, so the language leans closer to functional than object-oriented. There are no classes, no inheritance and no method dispatch; the one piece of OO machinery present is the actor, which is stateful and encapsulated behind a message boundary but has no polymorphism. See [Language Reference § Paradigm placement](docs/language-reference.md#paradigm-placement).

The load-bearing features:

- **Actor concurrency**, scheduled across cores by the runtime: lock-free messaging, locality-aware spawning, work stealing. See [Actor Concurrency](docs/actor-concurrency.md).
- **Config IS code**: library APIs double as typed, sandboxable configuration DSLs via trailing-block closures, so operators run real Aether instead of YAML. See [Config IS Code](docs/config-is-code.md).
- **Polyglot host, both directions**: run Lua / Python / Perl / Ruby / Tcl / JS in-process under the same grant list, or embed Aether into Python, Java, and Ruby through `--emit=lib` typed SDKs with per-guest memory and deadline caps. See [Embedding & emit=lib](docs/emit-lib.md).
- **Production networking in the stdlib**: an HTTP server with TLS, HTTP/2, WebSocket, SSE, and zero-copy `sendfile(2)`, plus an nginx-class reverse proxy. See [HTTP Server](docs/http-server.md) and [Reverse Proxy](docs/http-reverse-proxy.md).
- **A deliberate memory model**: manual-first with `defer`, automatic string-ownership tracking, and `requires`/`ensures` contracts that compile out at zero cost. See [Memory Management](docs/memory-management.md).
- **Ergonomics**: type inference, `(value, err)` multi-value returns, `@derive(eq)`, and a single `ae` command for build, run, test, fmt and packages. See [Language Reference](docs/language-reference.md).
- **Portability as a feature**: Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, WebAssembly, and embedded targets; cross-compile with `ae build --target=<triple>`. See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md).

## Benchmarks

Cross-language benchmark suite based on the [Savina Actor Benchmark Suite](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2687357.2687368), 11 languages × 5 patterns (ping-pong, counting, thread ring, fork-join, skynet). Both the benchmark runner and the visualization server are written in Aether, dogfooding the stdlib.

```bash
make benchmark    # Builds runner, runs all 55 benchmarks, opens UI at http://localhost:8080
```

See [Performance Benchmarks](docs/performance-benchmarks.md) for methodology and [benchmarks/cross-language/](benchmarks/cross-language/) for source.

## Quick Start

### Install

**Linux / macOS / FreeBSD, prebuilt binary (no toolchain, no build):**

Every [release](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases/latest) ships a ready-to-run tarball (`ae` + `aetherc` + stdlib) named `aether-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz`, where `<platform>` is one of `linux-x86_64`, `macos-arm64`, `macos-x86_64`, `freebsd-x86_64`. Grab the URL for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases/latest), then extract and add its `bin/` to your `PATH`:

```bash
# Example (substitute the current version + your platform from the Releases page):
VER=0.458.0; PLATFORM=linux-x86_64
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases/download/v${VER}/aether-${VER}-${PLATFORM}.tar.gz" | tar xz -C ~/.local
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"     # add to ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc to persist
ae version
```

**Linux / macOS, build from source (remote one-liner, no clone):**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/main/get.sh | sh
```

Fetches a pinned source tarball, builds the toolchain (Aether compiles to C, so the only prerequisites are a C compiler + GNU make, no tests run), and installs to `~/.local` (sudo-free). Pin a version with `AETHER_REF=<tag>` (see the [releases page](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases) for tags), or change the prefix with `PREFIX=/usr/local` (system-wide; needs sudo). Add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH` if it isn't already.

**Linux / macOS, full clone install** (editor extension, `ae version` management, shell-PATH setup, `~/.aether` layout):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether.git
cd aether
./install.sh
```

Installs to `~/.aether` and adds `ae` to your PATH. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`.

**Windows, download and run:**

1. Download `aether-*-windows-x86_64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases)
2. Extract to any folder (e.g. `C:\aether`)
3. Add `C:\aether\bin` to your PATH
4. **Restart your terminal** (so PATH takes effect)
5. Run `ae init hello && cd hello && ae run`

GCC is downloaded automatically the first time you run a program (~80 MB, one-time), no MSYS2 or manual toolchain setup required.

**All platforms, install, upgrade, and switch versions:**

```bash
ae version list              # see all available releases (newest first)
ae upgrade                   # install the latest release and switch to it
ae install                   # install the latest release (or `ae install <tag>` for a specific one)
ae use <tag>                 # switch to an already-installed version
```

Run `ae version list` (or check the [latest release](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases/latest)) to find the current tag; there's no need to hard-code one.

(The longer `ae version install <v>` / `ae version use <v>` forms still
work and are equivalent to `ae install` / `ae use`.)

### Your First Program

```bash
# Create a new project
ae init hello
cd hello
ae run
```

Or run a single file directly:

```bash
ae run examples/basics/hello.ae
```

### Editor Setup (Optional)

Install syntax highlighting for a better coding experience:

**VS Code / Cursor:**
```bash
cd editor/vscode
./install.sh
```

This provides:
- Syntax highlighting with TextMate grammar
- Custom "Aether Erlang" dark theme
- `.ae` file icons

### Development Build (without installing)

If you prefer to build without installing:

```bash
make ae
./build/ae version
./build/ae run examples/basics/hello.ae
```

### The `ae` Command

`ae` is the single entry point for everything, like `go` or `cargo`:

```bash
ae init <name>           # Create a new project
ae run [file.ae]         # Compile and run (file or project)
ae build [file.ae]       # Compile to executable
ae build --trace f.ae    # ...with message tracing compiled in (docs/message-tracing.md)
ae check [file.ae]       # Type-check without compiling (skips codegen + link)
ae fmt [--check] [path]  # Format source (stdin, or .ae files/dirs in place)
ae test [file|dir]       # Discover and run tests
ae examples [dir]        # Build all example programs
ae add <host/user/repo>  # Add a dependency (any git host)
ae repl                  # Start interactive REPL
ae cache                 # Show build cache info
ae cache clear           # Clear the build cache
ae inspect [file.ae]     # Show what a script declares (imports, capabilities, exports)
ae bindgen consts <h>    # Import C macro constants from a header as Aether consts
ae cflags                # Print -I/-L/-laether for embedding in external builds
ae checksec <binary>     # Report the hardening a built artifact carries
ae lib-path              # Print the resolved module-search chain
ae version               # Show current version
ae upgrade               # Install the latest release and switch to it
ae install <v>           # Install a specific release (latest if omitted)
ae use <v>               # Switch to an installed version
ae version list          # List all available releases
ae version installed     # List only the releases installed locally
ae version gc --keep 3   # Prune the store to the newest 3
ae version dedupe        # Share identical files across versions
ae help                  # Show all commands
```

In a project directory (with `aether.toml`), `ae run` and `ae build` compile `src/main.ae` as the program entry point. You can also pass `.` as the directory: `ae run .` or `ae build .`.

**Using Make (alternative):**

```bash
make compiler                    # Build compiler only
make ae                          # Build ae CLI tool
make test                        # Run runtime C test suite
make test-ae                     # Run .ae source tests
make test-all                    # Run all tests
make examples                    # Build all examples
make -j8                         # Parallel build
make help                        # Show all targets
```

### Building on Windows

The Aether build is GNU-make based. Use one of the two paths below, `nmake` from a Visual Studio Developer Prompt **will not work** (the Makefile uses GNU-only syntax that NMAKE can't parse).

**Just running Aether? Skip this section** and use the [release binary](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/releases), no MSYS2 setup required.

**Building from source, recommended (MSYS2 / MinGW-w64):**

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and open the **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit** shell (not the bare MSYS shell).
2. Install the toolchain:
   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-make \
             mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib \
             mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates pkg-config make bc
   ```
3. Clone and build:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether.git
   cd aether
   make ci   # full suite: compiler, ae, stdlib, REPL, C tests, .ae tests, examples
   ```

For HTTPS to verify certs, the `mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates` package above provides the bundle at `/mingw64/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`. Windows has no system PEM store, so that file (or another bundle) is what the runtime has to find. It auto-detects the default MSYS2 location and the one Git for Windows ships:

| Toolchain | Bundle |
|---|---|
| MSYS2 + `mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates` | `C:\msys64\mingw64\etc\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt` |
| Git for Windows (already installed if you cloned with it) | `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\etc\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt` |

Anywhere else — a non-default MSYS2 root, a custom bundle, a corporate CA — export `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the bundle's **native Windows** path:

```bash
export SSL_CERT_FILE="C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"
```

An MSYS-style path (`/mingw64/...`) will not work: a compiled Aether program is a plain Win32 binary and does not inherit MSYS2's virtual mounts. A build that finds no bundle fails every HTTPS request at the handshake.

Note also that a source build without OpenSSL has no TLS backend linked at all; such a program must `import std.cryptography.tls13_client` to get HTTPS. The error message says so if you forget.

**Native MSVC (cl.exe / nmake):** not currently supported as a full build path, tracker [#99](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether/issues/99). The MSVC matrix job in CI verifies our public headers parse under `cl.exe` so a future native MSVC port stays feasible, but `make` (the build system itself) requires GNU make. The MSYS2 MinGW build above is the supported source-build path for Windows today.

## Language Example

```aether
// Counter actor with message handling
message Increment {}
message Decrement {}
message Reset {}

actor Counter {
    state count = 0

    receive {
        Increment() -> {
            count = count + 1
        }
        Decrement() -> {
            count = count - 1
        }
        Reset() -> {
            count = 0
        }
    }
}

main() {
    // Spawn counter actor
    counter = spawn(Counter())

    // Send messages
    counter ! Increment {}
    counter ! Increment {}
    counter ! Decrement {}
    counter ! Reset {}
    counter ! Increment {}

    // Wait for all messages to be processed
    wait_for_idle()

    println("Final count: ${counter.count}")
}
```

## Closures and Builder DSL

Aether closures take three shapes after a function call. They look similar but have different semantics, picking the right one is the language's main lever for separating DSL structure from runtime behaviour.

| Mode | Syntax | Semantics |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Immediate** | `func() { block }` | Runs inline at the call site, used for DSL structure |
| **Closure** | `func() \|x\| { block }` | Real closure with explicit params, hoisted to a C function |
| **Callback** | `func() callback { block }` | Real closure that captures enclosing scope, no params needed |

```aether,fragment
// Immediate, declarative structure, runs during construction
panel("Settings") {
    button("OK")
    button("Cancel")
}

// Closure, explicit params, deferred invocation
apply_twice(x: int, f: fn) { return call(f, call(f, x)) }
doubler = |x: int| -> x * 2
println(apply_twice(3, doubler))    // 12

// Callback, captures from scope, runs when invoked
counter = ref(0)
btn("increment") callback { ref_set(counter, ref_get(counter) + 1) }
btn("decrement") callback { ref_set(counter, ref_get(counter) - 1) }
```

The compiler distinguishes them at parse time, which is what makes the sandboxing story (above) work: `hide`/`seal except` checks happen against the hoisted form of `closure` and `callback` blocks, so a `seal except req, res` on a callback body genuinely prevents the body from reaching outer scope. Immediate blocks inherit the caller's lexical scope by design, they're structure, not callbacks.

Inspired by Smalltalk blocks, Ruby's blocks/procs, Groovy closures, and Kotlin/SwiftUI's trailing-block DSLs. See [Closures and Builder DSL](docs/closures-and-builder-dsl.md) for the builder-context mechanism, ref cells, and full DSL pattern; see [Closure lineage and runtime tradeoffs](docs/design/closure-lineage-and-runtime-tradeoffs.md) for why Aether keeps closure-shaped values without adopting a Lisp/Smalltalk runtime.

## Config IS Code

**Don't ship a YAML loader.** If your Aether library has a "start the thing" surface, HTTP server, daemon, agent, scheduler, test rig, expose it as a closure-DSL block and let the operator's "config" be a `.ae` file they run with `ae run`. The pattern collapses YAML → templating → second-language-DSL (HCL, Helm) → embedded-scripting all into one thing: real Aether, type-checked, sandboxable, with the full stdlib available when the operator needs it.

```aether,fragment
import avnserver

main() {
    avnserver.serve {
        host("127.0.0.1")
        port(9990)
        superuser_token(env("SUPER_TOKEN"))   // computed at config time
        repo("alpha", "/srv/alpha")
        repo("beta",  "/srv/beta")
    }
}
```

Same file is config, validation, conditional logic, and the entry point. No second parser, no second type system, no template language. Sandboxing (`--emit=lib --with=...`, `hide`, `seal except`) keeps it safe to accept untrusted configs as the embedded-DSL case demands. See [Config IS Code](docs/config-is-code.md) for the full progression (YAML → HCL → Pulumi → here) and library-author recipe.

### Cross-Platform Testing

**CI runs automatically on:** Linux (GCC + Clang), macOS (ARM64 + x86_64), Windows (MinGW/MSYS2)

```bash
# Cooperative scheduler (no Docker needed)
make ci-coop

# Windows cross-compile syntax check (requires mingw-w64 or Docker)
make ci-windows              # needs: brew install mingw-w64
make docker-ci-windows       # or use Docker

# WebAssembly (requires Docker with Emscripten)
make docker-ci-wasm

# ARM embedded syntax check (requires Docker with arm-none-eabi-gcc)
make docker-ci-embedded

# All portability checks (coop + WASM + embedded)
make ci-portability
```

**`make ci` tests your current OS only.** No OS can locally test another OS natively, macOS cannot be virtualized on Linux/Windows, Windows build+run requires MSYS2. GitHub Actions CI automatically tests all 5 platform targets (Linux GCC, Linux Clang, macOS ARM64, macOS x86_64, Windows MinGW) on every PR. Docker targets (`docker-ci-windows`, `docker-ci-wasm`, `docker-ci-embedded`) provide cross-compilation syntax checking from any host.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full pre-PR checklist.

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run cross-language benchmark suite with interactive UI
make benchmark
# Open http://localhost:8080 to view results

```

The benchmark runner is written in Aether (`run_benchmarks.ae`), dogfooding the stdlib. It compiles and runs all 11 languages, parses output, and writes JSON results.

## Sibling Projects

The Aether ecosystem includes downstream consumers that live in their
own repos and release independently:

- **[aether-ui](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether-ui)**,
  Cross-platform widget toolkit (GTK4 on Linux, AppKit on macOS, Win32
  on Windows) with an AetherUIDriver HTTP test server for headless
  integration testing. Previously shipped as `contrib/aether_ui/` in
  this repo; spun out so it can iterate on its own cadence.
- **[aeb](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aeb)**, Build system for
  multi-package Aether projects. Reads `share/aether/MANIFEST` (the
  authoritative list of link-suitable runtime/stdlib `.c` files) and
  dispatches per-package builds with cache reuse and incremental
  relinking.

If you're adding to Aether and the change isn't a runtime / compiler /
stdlib concern, the right home may be one of the siblings above. Both
repos consume Aether the same way external users do, `import` against
the installed `share/aether/` tree plus `$(ae cflags)` for the link
line, so they're useful references for downstream integration shapes.

## Status

Aether is under active development. The compiler, runtime, and standard library are functional and tested.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Areas of interest:**
- Runtime optimizations
- Standard library expansion
- Documentation and examples

## Supporting Aether

Aether is free and open source, built and maintained in personal time. CI runners, cross-platform testing infrastructure, and future project hosting cost real money.

If Aether is useful to you, consider [sponsoring the project on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nicolas-maman). Every contribution goes directly into development and infrastructure.

## Acknowledgments

Aether's main lineage is:

- **Erlang/OTP**, actor model, message passing, receive-pattern syntax, and
  "let it be isolated behind a mailbox" concurrency.
- **Go**, pragmatic tooling, simple syntax, explicit `(value, err)` returns,
  and stdlib surfaces that favor direct operational code over framework magic.
- **Rust**, systems-programming discipline, explicit capability boundaries,
  zero-cost lowering goals, and careful ownership/lifetime thinking without
  adopting a borrow checker.
- **Pony**, actor-oriented type-safety ideas and the object-capability framing
  behind sandboxed imports, lexical `hide` / `seal`, and explicit grants.
- **Smalltalk / Ruby / Groovy**, block and closure ergonomics: trailing-block
  builders, `do |x| ... end`-style readability, and DSL-shaped APIs where the
  closure is the configuration.

Smaller facets are deliberately borrowed or adapted from elsewhere:

- **Elixir / Erlang lists**, for `*StringSeq`: O(1) head/tail/cons/length,
  structural sharing, and pattern matching with `[h | t]`.
- **Odin**, for struct field injection via `using embed: Sub` while omitting
  Odin's broader `using` statement form.
- **Nim / Pony**, for nominal wrapper and move-only-style ideas in features
  such as distinct types and isolated actor-message payloads.
- **V**, for compact systems-language ergonomics and some C-adjacent syntax
  choices in declarations, modules, and direct standard-library APIs.
- **Ruby**, for heredoc dedent rules in the `<<MARKER ... MARKER` syntax.
- **Go's standard library**, for concrete API semantics such as
  `filepath.Clean` / `filepath.Rel`-style path helpers and proxy environment
  handling compatible with `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`.
- **Java, gVisor, WASI, Deno, and FreeBSD Capsicum**, as comparison points and
  partial prior art for sandboxing, syscall boundaries, and capability-style
  containment.
- **HCL, Helm, Pulumi, CDK, and YAML ecosystems**, as the configuration systems
  Aether's trailing-block "config is code" style is intentionally designed to
  replace for programmable server-shaped libraries.
- **Rust macros, jOOQ, and RSpec**, as reference points for what Aether's
  trailing-block DSLs can express directly without a macro or code-generation
  layer.
