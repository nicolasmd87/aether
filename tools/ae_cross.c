 *
 *  `ae build --target=<triple>` builds a foreign-target binary using
 *  zig as a self-contained cross-compiler: zig bundles each target's
 *  libc, system headers and linker, so the Aether runtime and stdlib
 *  compile straight from source for the target. The platform backend
 *  (epoll vs kqueue, spawn_sandboxed_linux vs bsd) is chosen by the
 *  compile-time __linux__ / __APPLE__ macros zig predefines for the
 *  target, so one source set serves every target with no per-host
 *  file selection.
 *
 *  PR 1 scope: dependency-free programs. Stdlib modules whose C code
 *  needs an external library we cannot yet cross-build (openssl,
 *  nghttp2, zlib, pcre2) are left out of the compile set, and a
 *  program importing one is rejected up front with a clear message.
 *  Networking / crypto / compression / regex cross builds are the
 *  documented follow-up. Native builds are entirely unaffected.
