# Build System

## Overview

Aether uses a multi-tier build system with different optimization profiles for development, testing, and release builds.

## Project Configuration (`aether.toml`)

Every Aether project has an `aether.toml` at its root. `ae run` and `ae build` read it automatically.

### Minimal project

```toml
[package]
name = "myapp"
version = "0.1.0"

[[bin]]
name = "myapp"
path = "src/main.ae"
```

### Full configuration reference

```toml
[package]
name = "myapp"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "What this program does"

[build]
# Extra C compiler flags appended to the gcc invocation on every build path,
# including `ae run`. They come after the optimisation level, so a cflag like
# `-O3` overrides the `-O0` that `ae run` and `ae build --quick` use by default.
cflags = "-O3 -march=native"

# Platform-specific linker flags (e.g. for third-party C libraries).
# macOS/Linux: link_flags = "-lraylib"
# Windows:     link_flags = "-Ldeps/raylib/lib -lraylib -lopengl32 -lgdi32 -lwinmm"
link_flags = ""

[[bin]]
name = "myapp"
path = "src/main.ae"

# Extra C source files compiled alongside the Aether output.
# Useful for C FFI helpers, renderer backends, or any C code your program needs.
# Merged additively with any --extra flags passed on the command line.
extra_sources = ["src/ffi_helpers.c", "src/renderer.c"]
```

### Link flags you do not have to write

`link_flags` is for libraries *your* program needs. A library that a *module*
needs is declared by that module, with `@link` at the top of its `module.ae`:

```aether,fragment
@link("-laether_sqlite -lsqlite3")
```

Codegen unions those declarations across the resolved import closure into a
`// aether-link:` comment on the generated C, and `ae build` puts them on the
link command (#1549). So `import contrib.sqlite` links libsqlite3 without any
`aether.toml` entry, and it works transitively — a module three imports deep
contributes its own dependencies.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Your `link_flags` still win.** Module flags are placed before them on the
  command line, so anything you specify takes precedence.
- **A `-D`-dropped import drops its libraries too.** Because the flags come
  from the AST, an `import` inside a losing `when defined(...)` region never
  contributes them — the library is absent from the binary, not merely
  unused. Restating it in `link_flags` defeats this, since that is static and
  applies to every build. Prefer `@link` for a module's own dependencies.

`-L` search paths remain yours to supply; they are site-specific. The one
exception is `<lib_dir>/contrib`, added automatically so the veneer archives
`make contrib` builds resolve without configuration.

The `// aether-link:` comment also lists libraries for std modules backed by
native code (`std.http` names `-lssl -lcrypto -lnghttp2`). Those are there for
downstream C builds; `ae build` skips them, because it already passes the same
libraries from its own pkg-config detection — and passes *nothing* when the
library was not found, so `std.http` still links on a box without libnghttp2
and the h2 surface falls back to its "unavailable" stub. A module's `@link` is
for dependencies the toolchain does not probe for.

### `extra_sources` vs `--extra`

Both add C files to the build, they are additive when both are present.

| | `extra_sources` in `aether.toml` | `--extra file.c` CLI flag |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Always included for this binary | Per-invocation |
| **Good for** | C helpers your program always needs | Renderer backends, platform variants |
| **Works with** | `ae build` and `ae run` | `ae build` and `ae run` |

### `--quick` for fast iteration

By default, `ae build` runs the C compiler with `-O2` to match release-quality codegen. For tight edit/build/test loops where binary speed isn't critical, pass `--quick` to drop to `-O0 -g`:

```sh
ae build src/main.ae           # release-shape, -O2 (default)
ae build src/main.ae --quick   # iteration-shape, -O0 -g
```

`--quick` typically halves the gcc step on small programs, at the cost of unoptimised codegen. `ae run` already uses `-O0` regardless, since cache hits dominate over a single optimised compile.

### `--profile` for sampling profilers

`--profile` compiles with `-O2 -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer`:

```sh
ae build src/main.ae --profile   # -O2 -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer
perf record -g ./main            # attributable frames
perf report --stdio
```

Neither other mode serves this. The default `-O2` build carries no DWARF and
omits frame pointers, so a sampling profiler cannot unwind it — profiling
`std.http.server.lb` under load, gdb resolved 239 of 240 sampled frames as
`??`. And `--quick`'s `-O0` inlines nothing and keeps every temporary live, so
the hot spots it reports are not the ones the shipped binary has.

`--profile` keeps `-O2` precisely so the profile describes the code you ship,
and adds only what the profiler needs to attribute it. It works under
`--target` as well, for profiling a cross-built binary on the target machine.

`--coverage` takes precedence if both are passed: gcov's line attribution
needs `-O0`, which is a correctness requirement rather than a preference.

### `--size` for shipped artifacts

`--size` compiles with `-Os -g0` (`-Oz` under `--target`) and strips at link
time — `-Wl,--strip-all -Wl,--gc-sections` with GNU ld and LLD,
`-Wl,-x -Wl,-dead_strip` on Apple targets, whose linker rejects the GNU
spellings as unknown options:

```sh
ae build --target=wasm32-wasi --emit=lib mylib.ae -o lib.wasm          # 956,573 bytes
ae build --target=wasm32-wasi --emit=lib --size mylib.ae -o lib.wasm   #  24,942 bytes
```

Every other mode points at debugging — `--quick` is `-O0 -g`, `--profile` is
`-O2 -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer`, `--coverage` is `-O0 -g --coverage` — and the
default `-O2` sits between them. `--size` is the one that points at shipping.

**It matters most under `--target`.** `zig cc` emits DWARF **by default**, even
at `-O2`, and the cross backend passed no `-g0` — so a cross-compiled
`--emit=lib` artifact was overwhelmingly debug information. Measured on a
two-function wasi library, 97.4% of the module was `.debug*`/`name` sections;
code and data were the remaining 2.6%. The equivalent native `.so` has **zero**
`.debug*` sections, so this was a cross-path problem rather than something
every target shipped. Native builds still benefit, just far less: about 14% on
the same library, from `-Oz` and the symbol table.

Stripping is behaviour-preserving. The 24 KB module above still instantiates,
still exports every symbol, and still runs identically — including the
fail-stop panic path WASI has.

`-Os` rather than `-Oz` on the native path: gcc only gained `-Oz` in GCC 12,
and Ubuntu 22.04 — the CI baseline — ships GCC 11, where it is a hard error.
`-Os` is supported everywhere and gives nearly the same result. Cross builds do
use `-Oz`, because zig bundles its own clang and the version is not the host's
to vary.

Two things `--size` deliberately does not do:

- **It is not the default.** A 38× difference is discoverable; anyone shipping
  to a browser will find the flag. Stripping every build by default would make
  the first "why can't I get a stack trace from my wasm module" report
  genuinely hard to diagnose.
- **It does not strip `--emit=obj` or `--emit=csrc`.** Neither links, and an
  object file's symbols are exactly what whoever links it next needs. Those
  modes still get `-Oz -g0` for the compile, but no link-time stripping.

`--profile` takes precedence if both are passed: asking for a small artifact
and a profileable one is contradictory, and the debug-oriented reading is the
safer one.

### Resolving the build target

`ae build` accepts either a path to a `.ae` file or a `[[bin]]` name from `aether.toml`. The two are equivalent:

```sh
ae build src/main.ae   # explicit path
ae build myapp         # [[bin]] name = "myapp"
```

When the positional argument doesn't exist as a file, `ae` checks `aether.toml`'s `[[bin]]` entries for a matching `name = "..."` and uses that bin's `path` field. Cargo and similar build systems work the same way.

If you run `ae build` from a subdirectory and there's no `aether.toml` in the current directory, `ae` walks up the directory tree looking for one. When it finds an ancestor `aether.toml`, it switches to that directory before resolving paths, so `cd src && ae build main.ae` works as if you had run `ae build src/main.ae` from the project root, and `extra_sources` declared in the toml are still applied. Walk-up only happens when there's no toml in the current directory; a project with a local `aether.toml` always wins.

## Binary Hardening

`ae build` asks the C toolchain for the mitigations whose cost is a rounding
error next to what they catch, rather than inheriting whatever the platform
defaults to:

| flag | what it buys | where |
|---|---|---|
| `-fstack-protector-strong` | a canary on functions with buffers or address-taken locals | everywhere |
| `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` | bounds-checked `memcpy` / `sprintf` / `printf` wrappers | everywhere, on optimised builds only, since it needs `-O1` or better and warns without it |
| `-Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now` | full RELRO: the GOT is read-only before `main` | ELF |
| `-Wl,-z,noexecstack` | a non-executable stack even when a dependency forgets | ELF |
| `-fPIE -pie` | a position-independent executable, so ASLR applies to the program image | ELF executables (macOS and Windows produce relocatable images already) |
| `-Wl,--dynamicbase -Wl,--nxcompat` | ASLR and NX | PE |

`--emit=lib` and `--emit=obj` skip `-pie` (it contradicts `-shared`, and an
object file is linked by someone else). A project that wants a different
posture overrides it through `aether.toml`'s `[build] cflags`, which append
after these.

### `ae checksec` reads the artifact, not the intent

The flags above say what was asked for. What a binary ended up with is a
separate question, and the only honest answer comes from the file itself:

```text
$ ae checksec build/myprog
build/myprog (ELF)
  PIE          yes
  NX           yes
  RELRO        yes
  canary       yes
  FORTIFY      yes
  stripped     no
```

It reads ELF program and dynamic headers, Mach-O load commands, and PE
`DllCharacteristics` directly, so it needs no `checksec(1)`, `readelf` or
`otool` on the machine. A property the format has no concept of reports `n/a`
rather than a failure: RELRO is an ELF idea, and Mach-O keeps its dyld info
read-only by construction.

A property reporting `n/a` satisfies `--require`, so one gate line works on
every format: `ae checksec --require pie,nx,relro-full,canary,fortify` passes
on a hardened Mach-O, where RELRO does not exist, and holds an ELF to full
RELRO. `relro` without `-full` accepts partial RELRO; `relro-full` requires
`BIND_NOW`.

`n/a` also covers what a file genuinely cannot answer. Canary and FORTIFY are
read from names, and a PE need not carry any: the COFF symbol table is
optional, and mingw-w64 fortifies in its own headers, so the bound check is
inlined and the only name it can leave behind is the handler on the failing
branch. Where there are no names to read, `checksec` says `n/a` instead of
reporting an absence it did not observe. The protection is still there, and
the test suite proves it the way the file cannot: it builds a program that
copies 32 bytes into a 16-byte object and requires the process to die rather
than complete. That check runs on every platform, and the same overflow
completes normally when the flag is taken away.

`--require` turns the report into a gate, which is the part that keeps a
mitigation from disappearing in a flag change nobody notices:

```text
$ ae checksec --require pie,nx,relro-full,canary,fortify build/myprog
$ echo $?
0
```

A missing property prints a `FAIL` row and exits 1. `relro-full` demands
BIND_NOW; plain `relro` accepts partial.

Whether a `FORTIFY` call appears at all is the libc's decision, not the
flag's: glibc's headers redirect the printf family, Apple's do not for the
same source. The flag is passed on both; only the artifact knows.

### Hardening the toolchain itself

`make HARDEN=1` builds the compiler and runtime with
`-fstack-protector-all -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wformat -Wformat-security`, and CI
pins a leg that does so.

Object files carry no record of the flags that built them, so changing
`HARDEN` used to recompile nothing: `make HARDEN=1` after an ordinary build
relinked the same unhardened objects and reported success. The build now keeps
a digest of everything that changes code generation, and any change to it
forces the rebuild.

## Build Cache

Both `ae run` and `ae build` cache compiled binaries in `~/.aether/cache/`. The cache key is an FNV64 hash of:

- The source file's content
- The `aetherc` binary's mtime (recompile invalidates everything)
- `libaether.a`'s mtime (stdlib rebuild invalidates everything)
- Every `--extra` C file's *content* (editing an FFI shim invalidates the cache, not just touching it)
- Every imported lib module's *content*: the `.ae`/`.c`/`.h` files under each lib-search directory, walked recursively. This covers both an explicit `--lib`/`$AETHER_LIB_DIR` directory and the **default `lib/`** the compiler searches when neither is set (the `src/main.ae` + `lib/<name>/module.ae` package layout). Because entries are content-hashed rather than keyed on mtime+size, a same-second, same-size edit (a one-character constant flip in an editor-save loop) still invalidates the cache, and a bare `touch` does not. This lib-dir walk is POSIX-only; on Windows the key covers the entry file and `--extra` content but not lib-module edits, so a lib-module change there still needs `ae cache clear` until the walk is wired for Windows.
- The optimisation level (`-O0` for `ae run` and `ae build --quick`, `-O2` for default `ae build`)

`ae run` and `ae build` use separate cache slots so toggling between them doesn't churn one entry back and forth.

**Cost breakdown of a build:**
- Cache hit (`ae build`): copy the cached binary to the requested output path. Sub-millisecond on local disk.
- Cache hit (`ae run`): fork + exec the cached binary directly.
- Cache miss: full `aetherc` front-end + gcc compile + link. Dominant cost is gcc; `aetherc` is a small fraction.
- First macOS run: an extra one-time pause while the OS performs its Gatekeeper check on the newly compiled binary. Subsequent runs of the same cached binary are hit-path.

```bash
ae cache          # Show cache location and entry count
ae cache clear    # Delete all cached builds
```

Wasm builds, `--emit=lib`, and `--namespace` SDK generation skip the cache (different artefact shapes; each will get its own cache layout when measurement justifies it).

## Build Tiers

All builds go through the Makefile, which handles the full source list across subdirectories (`compiler/parser/`, `compiler/analysis/`, `compiler/codegen/`, `runtime/scheduler/`, `runtime/memory/`, etc.).

### Development Build

```bash
make compiler CFLAGS="-O0 -g -Icompiler -Iruntime -Iruntime/actors -Iruntime/scheduler -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter"
```

**Purpose**: Fast compilation with debug symbols for active development.

### Testing Build

```bash
make compiler    # Uses -O2 by default
```

**Purpose**: Moderate optimization for CI and testing.

### Release Build

```bash
make compiler CFLAGS="-O3 -march=native -flto -Icompiler -Iruntime -Iruntime/actors -Iruntime/scheduler -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter"
```

**Purpose**: Full optimization for production use and benchmarking.

**Flags:**
- `-O3`: Aggressive inlining, loop unrolling, auto-vectorization
- `-march=native`: CPU-specific instruction selection
- `-flto`: Link-time optimization for cross-translation-unit inlining

### Profile-Guided Optimization

```bash
# Stage 1: Instrument
gcc -O3 -march=native -fprofile-generate -o aetherc_pgo ...

# Stage 2: Profile (run representative workload)
./aetherc_pgo <typical_usage>

# Stage 3: Optimize with profile data
gcc -O3 -march=native -fprofile-use -o aetherc ...
```

PGO uses runtime profiling data to improve branch prediction, function inlining decisions, and code layout. It is used by major projects including Chrome, Firefox, CPython, and LLVM for their release builds.

## Incremental Compilation

**Dependency Tracking:**
```makefile
CFLAGS += -MMD -MP
-include $(DEPS)

build/%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```

The `-MMD` flag generates `.d` dependency files listing all headers included by each source file. Make uses these to rebuild only modified files and their dependents.

## Parallel Compilation

```bash
make -j8    # 8 parallel jobs
```

Limited by dependency ordering: some files must build before others.

## Cross-Compilation (PLATFORM variable)

The `PLATFORM` Makefile variable selects the scheduler backend and sets platform-specific flags:

```bash
# Native (default), multi-core scheduler, pthreads
make stdlib PLATFORM=native

# WebAssembly, cooperative scheduler, no pthreads/fs/net
make stdlib PLATFORM=wasm    # CC=emcc, -DAETHER_NO_THREADING/FILESYSTEM/NETWORKING

# Or use the ae CLI directly:
ae build --target wasm hello.ae    # Produces hello.js + hello.wasm
node hello.js                       # Run with Node.js

# Embedded, cooperative scheduler, no pthreads/fs/net/getenv
make stdlib PLATFORM=embedded    # -DAETHER_NO_THREADING/FILESYSTEM/NETWORKING/GETENV

# Override individual features on native
make stdlib EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DAETHER_NO_THREADING"    # Auto-selects cooperative scheduler
make stdlib EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DAETHER_NO_FILESYSTEM -DAETHER_NO_NETWORKING"
```

The Makefile auto-detects `AETHER_NO_THREADING` in `EXTRA_CFLAGS` and switches to the cooperative scheduler automatically. It also omits `-pthread` from linker flags.

### Cross-building the toolchain itself (`FREEBSD=1` / `WINDOWS=1`)

`PLATFORM` above selects a scheduler/feature profile. Two separate knobs
cross-build the **`ae`/`aetherc` toolchain itself** for another OS, both via
`zig cc`:

```bash
# FreeBSD x86_64 (needs a base sysroot: zig bundles no FreeBSD libc)
make compiler ae stdlib FREEBSD=1 ZIG=/path/to/zig AETHER_SYSROOT=/path/to/base

# Windows x86_64 — no sysroot needed: zig bundles the mingw-w64 headers + CRT
make compiler ae stdlib WINDOWS=1 ZIG=/path/to/zig
file build/ae.exe    # PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
```

Provision `zig` with the [aether-crossbuild](https://github.com/aether-lang-dev/aether-crossbuild)
repo's `scripts/get-zig.sh` (the same source CI uses).

Both cross builds are **capability-lean**: OpenSSL, zlib, nghttp2 and YAML are
forced off, because the host's `pkg-config` would resolve the *host's* Linux
libraries and poison the target binary. Those std features ship as their
"unavailable" stubs, exactly as in any build without the libraries. Vendored
PCRE2 needs no host library, so `std.regex` survives.

One `build/` tree holds one target's objects and archives — they are not
interchangeable (ELF vs PE). The tree carries a `build/.build-target` stamp and
a mismatching build stops immediately with an actionable error rather than
failing deep in the link; `make clean` between targets is the fix (and `clean`
itself is never blocked by the guard).

**Testing a cross-built toolchain**: see `AE_TEST_RUNNER` in the next
section.

### Testing with a runner (`AE_TEST_RUNNER`)

`ae run` and `ae test` normally exec the binary they just built. Setting
`AE_TEST_RUNNER` makes them prefix it with a wrapper instead — the same idea as
cargo's `CARGO_TARGET_<triple>_RUNNER`:

```bash
# Run the cross-built Windows toolchain's output under Wine
AE_TEST_RUNNER=wine make test-ae WINDOWS=1 ZIG=/path/to/zig

# Any wrapper works — qemu-user, a tracer, a timing harness
AE_TEST_RUNNER="qemu-aarch64 -L /sysroot" ae test
```

Unset or empty means "exec directly", so it is inert by default. The value may
carry its own arguments. Because the hook sits at the *edge*, nothing in
`std.spec` or in your test sources needs to know it is running under an
emulator — the same `describe`/`it` blocks run either way, and the
`AE_SPEC_FORMAT`/`AE_SPEC_REPORT` structured-report contract is inherited
straight through the wrapper.

Layer an extra exclusion list onto a sweep with
`make test-ae AE_SWEEP_EXTRA_PRUNE=<file>` (applies to both the `.ae` and
`.sh` sweeps).

**Wine and the Windows cross lane.** CI's `windows-cross` job
(`.github/workflows/windows.yml`) currently cross-builds only — it does not
run the suite under Wine. That was attempted and deferred for a structural
reason worth knowing before trying again: `ae` is a *compile-and-run* driver,
so `ae run`/`ae test` inside a Wine prefix want a **Windows** C toolchain
there to compile the C the compiler emits (the driver tries to fetch
MinGW-w64). Driving the *native* `ae` with `AE_CC="zig cc -target
x86_64-windows-gnu"` avoids that, but then needs a Windows `libaether.a`
kept alongside the native one — and one `build/` tree holds exactly one
target's archives. `tests/ae_sweep_prune_wine.txt` records which areas such
a lane must never claim to cover (fs/path semantics, sockets/h2, actor
timing, the LD_PRELOAD sandbox).

### Docker-Based Cross-Compilation

For cross-compilation without installing toolchains locally:

```bash
make docker-ci-wasm        # Emscripten SDK → compile + run with Node.js
make docker-ci-embedded    # arm-none-eabi-gcc → syntax-check
make ci-portability        # All: native coop + WASM + embedded
```

### RISC-V 64-bit (`ci-riscv64`)

Cross-compile + run-under-qemu portability check:

```bash
# Install host toolchain (Ubuntu 22.04+):
sudo apt-get install -y gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu \
    libc6-dev-riscv64-cross qemu-user-static

# Cross-compile compiler/ae/stdlib for riscv64; verify the binaries
# are riscv64 ELF; smoke-run them under qemu-user-static.
make ci-riscv64
```

Useful for catching pointer-width, struct-padding, and atomic-
instruction-availability bugs that an x86_64-only matrix can't
surface. Optional libs (OpenSSL, zlib, nghttp2, GTK4) are disabled
in the riscv64 build because the host runner's pkg-config returns
x86_64 lib paths, the std.* feature-detection wrappers fall into
their "unavailable" stubs cleanly.

Docker images: `docker/Dockerfile.wasm` (Emscripten), `docker/Dockerfile.embedded` (ARM Cortex-M4).

### `ae build` with an alternate or cross C compiler (`$CC` / `$AE_CC`)

`ae build`, `ae run`, and `ae build --emit=lib` select their C-backend
compiler the way the Makefile does: they honor `$AE_CC` first, then `$CC`,
falling back to `gcc` (the WinLibs-bundled gcc on Windows) when neither is
set. This affects only the C backend that turns Aether's generated C into the
final binary; it never changes `aetherc`, the Aether-to-C front end.

The same-OS, cross-arch cell is then a one-liner. On an x86_64 Linux host with
a cross-gcc installed:

```bash
CC=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc ae build --emit=lib core/embed.ae -o libfoo.so
file libfoo.so          # => ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64
qemu-aarch64 ./probe    # load/run the emitted lib under an emulator
```

That produces an arm64 `.so` on a cheap x86_64 runner with no arm64 hardware
and no new codegen. A compiler that cannot be found fails fast with
`C compiler '<name>' (from $CC) not found` rather than a later link error.
Cross-**OS** targets (for example Linux to macOS) need a matching C toolchain
plus that OS's headers, which a stock cross-gcc does not carry: for those, use
the `zig cc` backend below.

### `ae build --target=<triple>` (cross-OS via a `zig cc` backend)

`ae build --target=<triple>` cross-compiles a foreign-OS/arch binary using
[zig](https://ziglang.org) as a self-contained cross toolchain. zig bundles
each target's libc, system headers, and linker, so the Aether runtime and
standard library compile straight from source for the target: no cross-gcc, no
target sysroot, no per-host file juggling. The platform backend (`epoll` vs
`kqueue`, `spawn_sandboxed_linux` vs the BSD/stub path) is selected by the
`__linux__` / `__APPLE__` macros zig predefines for the target, so one source
set serves every target.

```bash
ae build --target=x86_64-linux      hello.ae -o hello  # ELF x86-64, glibc
ae build --target=x86_64-linux-musl hello.ae -o hello  # ELF x86-64, static
ae build --target=aarch64-macos     hello.ae -o hello  # Mach-O arm64
```

**glibc or musl on Linux.** The `-linux` triples link against glibc
dynamically, so the artifact carries the GLIBC symbol version of whatever
built it and will not start on an older distro. The `-linux-musl` triples
link musl statically instead: no dynamic libc dependency, no version floor,
and the same binary runs on any Linux of that architecture — including Alpine
and other musl distros. Prefer musl for anything you publish; see
**[release-glibc-portability.md](release-glibc-portability.md)**.

Supported triples: `aarch64-macos`, `x86_64-macos`, `aarch64-linux`,
`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux-musl`, `x86_64-linux-musl` (the
`arm64-`/`amd64-` spellings are accepted too). Zig 0.16.0
or newer must be on `PATH` (`brew install zig`, or use the checksum-pinned
`scripts/get-zig.sh`); the build fails fast with an install hint otherwise.

### iOS: `--target=aarch64-ios` (Xcode backend)

iOS is the one cross target that does **not** go through zig: the Apple SDKs are
Xcode-licensed and not redistributable, so `aarch64-ios`,
`aarch64-ios-simulator`, `x86_64-ios-simulator` and the Mac Catalyst triples
(`aarch64-ios-macabi`, `x86_64-ios-macabi`) shell to `xcrun clang`
instead and require a macOS host with Xcode. `--emit=staticlib` produces a
single `.a` holding the program plus the Aether runtime and stdlib — the shape
an App Store build needs, since iOS forbids third-party dynamic libraries —
and `--emit=lib` produces an `@rpath`-installed Mach-O dylib for local
development. Either way an iOS app is built by Xcode, and what it wants from
Aether is a library, not a standalone binary. Full details, including the sandbox restrictions that apply
at runtime, are in **[cross-ios.md](cross-ios.md)**.

**How it links.** The full runtime and standard library are compiled from
source for the target and archived, then the program links against that
archive, so the linker pulls only the objects it references, exactly as a
native `-laether` link against the complete `libaether.a` does. The first build
recompiles the runtime from source (a few seconds); caching the per-target
archive is a planned optimization.

**Scope.** Cross binaries are built without OpenSSL / zlib / nghttp2
(zig ships none of those), so standard-library features that need them
(HTTPS/TLS, hashing, base64, compression, HTTP/2) report errors at
runtime, exactly like a native build on a host that lacks those libraries;
plain sockets and pure helpers keep working. `ae build` prints a note when a
program uses such a module (`std.http`, `std.net`, `std.cryptography`,
`std.zlib`, `std.encoding`), then builds it anyway. Cross-building
those libraries is the documented follow-up; staging them via
`CROSSBUILD_SYSROOT` (provisioned by aether-crossbuild) links them for real
today. **`std.regex` is the exception: it always works on cross builds, with
no sysroot** — its engine is vendored in-tree (`std/regex/pcre2/`, pinned
upstream PCRE2 compiled by `std/regex/aether_pcre2_vendored.c`; #1389), so a
regex-using program cross-builds self-contained for every target. A
CROSSBUILD_SYSROOT that stages a real libpcre2-8 takes precedence over the
vendored copy. Executables, **`--emit=csrc`, `--emit=obj` and `--emit=lib`**
are supported, and the host must be POSIX (Linux/macOS). The generated
artifact targets another platform, so it is not runnable on the build host;
copy it to a matching machine (or an emulator).

`--emit=csrc` is allowed under `--target` because it never links: it writes
the portable C, its catalog header and the JSON catalog, and stops (#1648).

**`--emit=lib` under `--target`** produces a real shared library for the
target (#1648): an ELF `.so`, a PE `.dll`, or a Mach-O `.dylib`, chosen by the
*target* rather than the host. zig links a shared object for a target as
readily as an executable, and the runtime and stdlib are already compiled from
source for that target on the executable path, so `-shared -fPIC` instead of
an executable link is the whole increment.

| target | artifact | extra link flags |
|---|---|---|
| `*-linux`, other ELF | `.so` | `-shared -fPIC` |
| `*-windows` | `.dll` | `-shared -fPIC -Wl,--export-all-symbols` |
| `*-macos`, `*-ios` | `.dylib` | `-dynamiclib -install_name @rpath/<leaf>` |
| `wasm32-*` | `.wasm` | `--no-entry --gc-sections` + `--export=` per symbol |

Windows needs `--export-all-symbols` for the reason the native path documents
(#993): GCC's auto-export heuristic switches off as soon as any symbol carries
an explicit `__declspec(dllexport)`, and the `aether_<name>` catalog exports
then vanish from the DLL. A Windows `--emit=lib` is named `.dll`, not `.exe` —
the executable suffix is applied only to executables.

**`--emit=both` is still rejected under `--target`**: it wants an executable
*and* a library from one invocation, and the cross path links once. Run it
twice with different `--emit` modes.
That makes it the route to a **cross-compiled linkable library without
cross-link support** — emit the C here, and let the consumer compile it for
their target into the `.so` / `.a` / `.wasm` they need.

The emitted C is **target-neutral**, not target-parameterised: platform
selection stays in `#if __linux__` / `__APPLE__` / `__wasi__` and is resolved
by the consumer's compiler, which defines those macros for whatever target it
builds. `--target` therefore does not change the bytes emitted (asserted by
`tests/integration/emit_csrc_cross/`); it is accepted so one command line
works for both native and cross consumers. For the same reason csrc under
`--target` does **not** require `zig` on PATH — nothing is compiled or linked.

`--emit=obj` is the other non-linking mode, and is allowed under `--target` for
the same reason: it stops at `zig cc -target <triple> -c`. Unlike csrc it emits
a **target-format object** — real machine code for the triple — so it *does*
need `zig`:

```
$ ae build --target=aarch64-linux  --emit=obj lib.ae -o lib.o && file lib.o
lib.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, ARM aarch64
$ ae build --target=x86_64-windows --emit=obj lib.ae -o lib.o && file lib.o
lib.o: Intel amd64 COFF object file
$ ae build --target=x86_64-macos   --emit=obj lib.ae -o lib.o && file lib.o
lib.o: Mach-O 64-bit x86_64 object
```

`AE_CC`/`CC` are deliberately **not** consulted on the cross object path: they
name a host compiler, and honouring them would silently produce a host object
for a command that asked for a cross one. The consumer links the object with
their own `libaether.a` and system libraries for the target, exactly as they do
for a native `--emit=obj`.

### WebAssembly: two backends, selected by target name

There are **two** wasm paths, and they are not interchangeable:

| Target | Backend | Produces | Supported modes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--target=wasm` | Emscripten (`emcc`) | `.js` + `.wasm` bundle | executables |
| `--target=wasm32-wasi` | `zig cc` | a self-contained wasm module | executables, `--emit=csrc`, `--emit=obj` |

Emscripten supplies a JS host, a DOM/filesystem shim and its own pthread
emulation; the zig path produces a plain object a WASI runtime (or someone
else's wasm link) consumes. Neither supersedes the other, so they are chosen by
different target names rather than one silently switching backend.

`wasm32-wasi` goes through the same cross machinery as every other triple, so
`--emit=obj` yields a real module:

```
$ ae build --target=wasm32-wasi --emit=obj lib.ae -o lib.o && file lib.o
lib.o: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

**The two WASI defines are injected automatically.** WASI's `setjmp.h` refuses
to compile without `-D__wasm_exception_handling__=1` (*"Setjmp/longjmp support
requires Exception handling support"*), and WASI has no POSIX signal API
without `-D_WASI_EMULATED_SIGNAL`. `ae build` adds both when the target
resolves to a WASI triple, so nothing needs passing by hand.

**A full executable link works** as of #1655 — including actor programs:

```
$ ae build --target=wasm32-wasi hello.ae -o hello.wasm
$ wasmtime hello.wasm
hello from wasi
```

Four things had to change for that, and they are worth knowing because each
was a place where WASI had been forgotten beside Emscripten:

- **The scheduler.** WASI has no usable threads, but zig's wasi-libc ships
  pthread *stubs* whose `pthread_create` returns `EAGAIN` — so the threaded
  runtime linked, started, printed "Failed to create scheduler thread", and
  then span forever on `scheduler_start()`'s readiness barrier. A wasi exe now
  selects the cooperative scheduler, the same substitution the Emscripten
  backend has always made.
- **`AETHER_HAS_PROCESS`** (new). `std/os/aether_os.c` was guarded entirely by
  `!AETHER_HAS_FILESYSTEM`, so the only way to compile out `fork` was to
  compile out the filesystem with it. Emscripten accepts that trade; WASI must
  not, because a capability-based filesystem is the point of WASI. The two
  capabilities are now separate.
- **Computed-goto dispatch.** Actor codegen emits a table of label addresses,
  which wasm rejects ("relocations for function or section offsets are only
  supported in metadata sections"). The guard excluded `__EMSCRIPTEN__` but
  not `__wasi__`.
- **`setjmp`/`longjmp` selection.** `aether_panic.c` guarded its crash handler
  with `!defined(__wasi__)`, but `aether_panic.h`'s macro selection did not.
  WASI is hosted and does not define `__EMSCRIPTEN__`, so it fell into the
  POSIX arm and got `_setjmp`/`_longjmp` — which wasi-libc declares but never
  implements. A **link** error, so it surfaced only at the end of a cross
  build (`undefined symbol: _longjmp`). See the caveat below.

### `panic` / `try` / `catch` are fail-stop on WASI

There is no working `setjmp` on `wasm32-wasi` in either spelling. `_setjmp` is
declared but unimplemented; plain `setjmp` is a hard `#error` in wasi-libc
directing you to `-mllvm -wasm-enable-sjlj` and an engine implementing the
exception-handling proposal (measured on zig 0.16.0, that flag does not help —
the `#error` fires first). Real support needs the WebAssembly
exception-handling proposal in both toolchain and engine.

So on WASI the runtime **does not unwind**: `AETHER_SIGSETJMP` always takes the
first-return arm and `AETHER_SIGLONGJMP` calls `abort()`. A `panic()` traps the
instance instead of unwinding to the nearest `catch`, and a `catch` block
therefore never runs:

```
$ node --experimental-wasi call.mjs module.wasm
aether: panic outside any try/catch or actor: negative
safe(-1) -> trapped: RuntimeError
```

That message says "outside any try/catch" even when there *is* one, because the
frame never registers. This is a real semantic reduction, and the alternative
is that WASI cannot link at all. Nothing silently mis-executes: `abort()` is a
trap the host observes, not a fallthrough into a half-unwound stack. Code
targeting WASI should treat `panic` as fatal and use `(value, err)` returns for
anything it expects to recover from.

`--target=wasm` remains the route to a runnable **browser** bundle with JS
glue; `wasm32-wasi` produces a self-contained module for a WASI runtime.

`wasm32-freestanding` is deliberately **not** offered: it ships no libc, so the
generated C's `#include <stdio.h>` cannot resolve and `--emit=obj` fails
outright. Its only working mode would be `--emit=csrc`, which emits the same
target-neutral bytes as every other target anyway.

The same vendored engine backs two native cases: a build box with no system
libpcre2-8 (`make` compiles the vendored copy instead of stubbing
`std.regex` out — `PCRE2=0` restores the stub, `PCRE2=vendored` forces the
vendored engine even when a system library exists), and `ae`'s
no-`libaether.a` source fallback, which always compiles the vendored engine
so an installed toolchain never ships a silently-stubbed regex.

| Cross-wasm | `ae build --target=wasm32-wasi` | `zig cc` backend; executables + `--emit=csrc`/`--emit=obj` |

## Hardening (`HARDEN=1`)

Opt-in hardening flags add stack canaries, fortified libc-call wrappers, and format-string-injection diagnostics. Enabled with the `HARDEN=1` environment variable; disabled by default in release builds because the runtime overhead is non-zero (~3-5% on micro-benchmarks) and macOS Clang has historically been finicky with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE` on a few setups.

```bash
# Local hardened build, recommended before submitting a PR that
# touches C in compiler/, runtime/, or std/.
HARDEN=1 make compiler ae stdlib

# Hardened CI: run the full suite end-to-end under hardening.
HARDEN=1 make ci
```

Flags enabled:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-fstack-protector-all` | Stack canaries on every function (not just gcc-strong heuristic candidates), catches the smashing class of bugs that escape the default heuristic. |
| `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` | Runtime checks on `read`/`write`/`memcpy`/`strncpy`/`printf`-family calls. Linux `gcc` also emits compile-time warnings when it can prove a buffer overflow, those should be fixed at the source, never blanket-suppressed. Requires at least `-O1`; the default `-O2` satisfies that. |
| `-Wformat -Wformat-security` | Diagnose `printf`-family format strings sourced from non-literals (the `%s`-format-injection class). Default in modern Linux distros; we standardise on it explicitly. |

The flags are added to `CFLAGS` only when `HARDEN=1` is set; the default build path is byte-identical to the unhardened release. The Linux/Hardened (gcc) CI matrix entry pins this so a regression that introduces an unchecked `memcpy`-over-fixed-buffer trips a red check before merge.

## LLM diagnostics (`AETHER_ENABLE_LLM=1`)

`ae help <script> --llm <weights.gguf>` is an opt-in offline local-LLM escalation
path for the [config-IS-code diagnostic flow](cic-help.md). Default
builds omit the LLM module entirely so the binary stays small and the link line
stays dependency-light; embedders enable it explicitly at build time.

```bash
# Default build, `ae help --llm <path>` returns a clear "rebuild with
# AETHER_ENABLE_LLM=1" message; no llama.cpp dependency.
make ae

# LLM-enabled build, requires llama.cpp built and linkable. The shim
# in `tools/llm_shim.c` targets the stable `llama.h` C API.
make ae AETHER_ENABLE_LLM=1 \
    LLM_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/llama.cpp/build -lllama -lggml -lstdc++ -lm" \
    LLM_CFLAGS="-I/path/to/llama.cpp"
```

Hard privacy invariants (enforced by code structure + a Linux CI `strace -e network` guard):

- **No network calls.** The shim opens exactly the weights file the user names.
  No download, no fetch, no telemetry, no "anonymised usage stats." Same offline
  as online.
- **No bundled weights.** We ship no `.gguf`. You bring your own (3-7B range
  works on a laptop CPU; larger models also fine but slower).
- **No model marketplace integration.** No `ae help --download-model`. Path
  argument only; a missing path is a clean error, not a "would you like to fetch
  it?" prompt.
- **Stripped builds (default) omit the entire module.** A binary built without
  `AETHER_ENABLE_LLM=1` cannot run inference even if someone passes `--llm
  <path>`, they get the documented "rebuild with the flag" message instead.

The shim's surface is a single C function (`int ae_llm_run(const char* weights_path,
const char* prompt, FILE* out)`); upstream API rotations in llama.cpp need
touching only that one TU. See [`docs/cic-help.md`](cic-help.md) for the full
design.
